    "A disaster has struck a futuristic smart city, and your task is to develop an AI-powered drone navigation system to rescue stranded survivors. The drone must autonomously navigate through the city, avoiding obstacles like collapsed buildings and fire zones while optimizing for the fastest route (equivalent to minimum energy consumption).\n",

    "* East (x, y+1, z), West (x, y-1, z).\n",
    "* Diagonal movements (like flying at an angle) are not allowed for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Energy Consumption Factor:\n",
    "* Moving through clear space (0) costs 1 energy unit.\n",
    "* Moving through fire zones (F) costs 3 energy units due to turbulence.\n",
    "* Moving upwards (z+1) costs extra 2 energy units, while descending (z-1) costs 1 energy unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Objective:\n",
    "* The drone must rescue all survivors before returning to base (B).\n",
    "* The optimal path minimizes total energy consumption.\n",
    "* If needed, the drone can recharge at (R), but stopping at a station adds a fixed time penalty."
