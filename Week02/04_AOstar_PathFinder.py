##04_AO*_PathFinder

In a spatial context defined by a square matrix of order N * N, a rat is situated at the starting point (0,0), aiming to reach the destination at (N-1, N-1).
The task at hand is to enumerate all feasible paths that the rat can undertake to traverse from the source to the destination.

The permissible directions for the rat's movement are denoted as 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and 'R' (right).

Within this matrix, a cell assigned the value 0 signifies an obstruction, rendering it impassable for the rat, while a value of 1 indicates a traversable cell. The objective is to furnish a list of paths in lexicographically increasing order, with the constraint that no cell can be revisited along the path. Moreover, if the source cell is assigned a value of 0, the rat is precluded from moving to any other cell.

To accomplish this, the AO* Search algorithm is employed to systematically explore the AND-OR graph and evaluate all conceivable paths from source to destination (with path cost = 1, and heuristic values given in the diagram).

The algorithm dynamically adapts its heuristic function during the search, optimizing the exploration process. The resultant list of paths reflects a meticulous exploration of the matrix, ensuring lexicographical order and adherence to the specified constraints.
